In this Project, you will (what they will do) and practice (what they will practice) in order to (what they will learn).

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it
- This is why you are doing this particular lab exercise 
- This is the value to your future self if you do this lab exercise

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review after (thing you want them to complete)
2. Apprentices will obtain a code review after (other thing you want them to complete)

## Setup Instructions (DO NOT DELETE - GOES IN EVERY LAB EXERCISE)
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop.  
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder.  
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`.  
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository.  

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the lab exercise to what was covered in the associated lecture.
- Also ask questions that connect this lab exercise to prior lessons.
- Also ask questions that require the Apprentice to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can Apprentices work on once they have fulfilled the basic requirements for this lab exercise? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
